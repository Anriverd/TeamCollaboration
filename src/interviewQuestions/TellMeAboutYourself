Tell me about yourself:
I came to the US 6 years ago, started looking for a job ->
and I have a friend who was a SDET. ->
He offered me a position as a manual tester at his company, but I said that I want to do smth that i love to do,
I didn't wanna do smth just to earn money ->
He invited me to his house to show me what he is doing, what he activity is ->
And I really liked it, I was like what are you doing, it looks amazing, it looks for me like a puzzle, that I love to solve ->
And one manual tester position was open at that moment he invited me to join his company.
I went through the interview.
Then I worked as a manual tester for a year and then they started KT sessions in our company,
where some SDET's from different teams shared their knowledge. I started to study automation with them and
by watch in some videos on YouTube.
Now I can say that I enjoy my job, cause my job is my hobby at the same time and I can say that I follow the
main principle of my life: do what you love, and love what you do.

this is an extra line for practice
